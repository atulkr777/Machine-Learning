# Machine-Learning (Algorithm Bias)


Objective
The objective of this project is to assess the impact of algorithm bias on machine learning algorithms trained with imbalanced data.

1. Loading the Survival dataset and assessing the bias of classifiers trained on this dataset.
2. Proposing a strategy to rectify this bias. Evaluating the effect of this strategy in terms of classification bias and overall accuracy.
3. Testing the impact of this strategy on another dataset. Discussing the effectiveness of the strategy on the second dataset.
